# Computer-Music
Uses JFugue instruments and notation to generate, play back, and then transcribe a completely computer-generated song.
Only needs Java installed to run and generate music you can listen to, but also requires having LilyPond installed 
(can be found at https://lilypond.org/) to view the transcribed melodies.

## Some Songs Generated
- via youtube, add these later

## How to Use
- Clone the repo.
- Go to the directory in terminal.
- run `java -cp JFugue/jfugue-5.0.9.jar; Main` and then follow the GUI prompts.
  -  Note: As stated earlier, it is required to have LilyPond to view the sheet music for the melodies.
  However, it is not necessary to generate melodies.
  -  Also Note: Even if a melody was generated with the drums and/or chords off, they can still be turned 
  on when the song text is inputted into the "Input Song" field. Vice Versa also applies.
- Have fun!
